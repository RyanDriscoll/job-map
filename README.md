# TWork

### Use twitter to find and share job leads in your community

## About
 - Built for a hackathon project with the idea of helping students with disabilities find employment
 - Students or employers could post job leads as easily as tweeting with location information and a common hashtag
 - Tweeted job leads show on a Google map, change color with age and are eventually removed
 - TWork was made with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL on the backend and Angularjs 1.5 on the frontend.
